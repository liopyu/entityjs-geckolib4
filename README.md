# GeckoLib 4.0 to 1.19.2 Backport

## Introduction
Welcome to the GeckoLib 1.19.2 Backport repository! This project brings the power of GeckoLib's 4.0 animation engine to Minecraft version 1.19.2. Originally developed for version 1.19.3, this backport enables users to leverage advanced animation capabilities within their Minecraft mods. Originally made for my personal use in EntityJS Mod as it's animation engine, this also doubles as a generic backport and useable as you would with Gecko's 4.0+ versions.


## Features
- **Backported Animation Engine**: Enjoy the full functionality of GeckoLib's 1.19.3 animation engine in the unsupported Minecraft 1.19.2.

## Usage
Refer to the [official GeckoLib documentation](https://github.com/bernie-g/geckolib/wiki) for comprehensive guidance on utilizing the animation engine in your Minecraft mods.
